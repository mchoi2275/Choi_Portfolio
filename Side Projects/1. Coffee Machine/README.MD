Created a program that emulates a coffee machine

1. Prompt the customer for three choices of coffee (espresso/latte/cappuccino)

2. Can turn off/end program if the prompt "off" is typed in the input

3. Print a report for the user if the prompt "report" is typed into the input. It'll display the current resources remaining and profit that has accumulated.

4. It'll check if there are sufficient resources and would prompt the customer if there is no more ingredients to product the coffee.

5. Process the coins (quarters, dimes, nickels) the customer input into the terminal and would return the change.

6. Make the coffee by deduct the resources and would prompt the customer its ready.
